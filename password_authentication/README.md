# Password Authentication 

Any application that stores passwords has to ensure that its passwords are stored securely. 
You canâ€™t just store passwords as plain text, and it should ideally be impossible to guess your users passwords, 
even if you have access to their data.

## The Proper Way To Store Passwords

We cannot store our users passwords as we receive them.
We need to transform each password in such a way that it is easy to verify, but not easy to guess. 
We achieve this using a one-way hashing function (which would be the bcrypt algorithm in this case).


During login, we can check if a password is correct for a given username by retrieving the password hash for that username, and using the bcrypt compare function to verifying the given password with the hash:


## HTTP Server Implementation

We are going to build an HTTP server with two routes: /signup and /signin, and use a Postgres DB to store user credentials.
- [x] /signup will accept user credentials, and securely store them in our database.-
- [X] /signin will accept user credentials, and authenticate them by comparing them with the entries in the database.


## MySQL Table 

```
create database pwdauth;
use pwdauth;
create table users( username varchar(256) PRIMARY KEY , password varchar(256));
```
